# webapp-starter
Front-end boilerplate for single-page web apps using LESS, Gulp, Jade, Mithril.js

# Usage
To use webapp-starter in your own project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Delete `README.md`.
3. Delete `LICENSE`. Yes, I'm allowing you to do this. As soon as README.md is gone, LICENSE doesn't apply anymore.
4. Run `npm install`.
5. Rename the `webapp-starter` directory to whatever you like.
